# State Capital Program: An Array and HashMap Practice in Java

This repository contains a practical Java application, `StateCapitalProgram`, designed to showcase the use and manipulation of two common data structures, Arrays and HashMaps.

## Program Description

`StateCapitalProgram` is a command-line application that performs two primary operations:

1. **Array Manipulation**: A two-dimensional array stores pairs of U.S. states and their respective capitals. The program can interactively prompt users for the capital of a state and evaluate the input. It then displays the array data, sorts it using the Bubble Sort algorithm, and prompts the user to identify all the state capitals.
2. **HashMap Manipulation**: It modifies the same process by substituting the two-dimensional array with a HashMap, which facilitates data retrieval. The HashMap content is then sorted using a TreeMap and leverages binary search tree storage.

## Setup

To run the `StateCapitalProgram`, you must install Java on your local machine. Follow the steps below:

- **Clone the repository**: Use `git clone <repository-url>` to clone this repository to your local machine.
- **Navigate to the cloned directory**: Use the `cd <directory>` command to move into the directory of the cloned repository.
- **Compile the Program**: Use `javac StateCapitalProgram.java` to compile the Java program.
- **Run the Program**: Use `java StateCapitalProgram` to run the program.

## Usage

Upon successful compilation and running of the program, you will be prompted to interact with the program via the command line. Follow the prompts for a walk-through of the sorting and searching operations on arrays and HashMaps.
